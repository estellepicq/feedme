# Feed Me

> (05/11/2022) I am archiving this repository, as the feedme app is no longer useful. I am gathering feedme and savr features into [savr](https://github.com/estellepicq/savr) app.

## Description

Feed Me website

## Install

* `git clone git@github.com:estellepicq/feedme.git`
* `npm install`

## Dev

* `npm run start`: watch src files and server files
* Go to http://localhost:8086
* When you do a modification in a source file (css, js, views...), changes are compiled automatically, but you will need to reload your browser manually.

## Build

* `npm run build`
